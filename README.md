# t0ky0

## A modern, vibrant color theme inspired by Shibuya and Tokyo Night.

t0ky0 is a dark Visual Studio Code color theme featuring bright, vibrant text colors and dark, subtle blue-toned background. With consistent coloring for variables, control flow statements and operators, the goal is to easily draw your attention to the places in your files that matter.  
This project is **based on the excellent [Shibuya][shibuya_jeroen_meijer] color theme by [jeroen-meijer][jeroen_meijer]**.  
The recommended font is [Fira Code][fira_code] with ligatures enabled.
